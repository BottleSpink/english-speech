	text: `Six of us stayed here for the weekend. 
	The first thing we noticed on entering our room was how small it was. 
	Our rooms were clean, but the bed cover was stained.
	The furniture was really outdated, especially the bathroom, which had an old pink suite and linoleum on the floor. 
	The shower was a hose that you fit onto the taps.  
	The sink was in the bedroom, right next to the television sockets which seems pretty unsafe to me. 
	We had dinner there, and it was well-cooked, but we were still hungry afterwards because the servings were so tiny. 
	The drinks prices were extortionate - five euro for a small glass of wine. 
	My friend ordered a brandy and coke, but the waitress brought him whisky and coke. 
	When we complained, she just walked off! Not impressed. 
	I would like to say it was cheap and cheerful but at one hundred and twenty euro a night, it was neither - overpriced and depressing more like.`

	text: `Just returned from a three day break here, and thought that the Coach Hotel was very good value for money. 
	I had requested a quiet room and this was noted at reception. 
	I got a great room - large, comfortable and clean, with a seating area overlooking the racecourse. 
	The only disappointing thing was that there were no tea or coffee facilities in the room - not even a kettle. 
	The furniture and decor was not particularly up-to-date, but that’s what you would expect from an old hotel. 
	There was a wide selection of well-cooked food on offer. 
	At breakfast I had poached eggs, and they were done to perfection. 
	In the evening, I had a delicious three-course meal, and I wasn’t kept waiting for ages between courses, which is definitely a plus when you’re dining alone. 
	I found the staff friendly and always willing to help.`

	There’s plenty of space to park. 
	The bed was comfortable with clean cotton sheets. 
	Good power shower. 
	I would agree with some of the less favourable reviews on the site too, though. 
	The room definitely needed some attention – it smelt musty and the furniture was old, cheap and battered.  
	The bin hadn't been emptied from previous guests, and there was other rubbish on the floor. 
	The fan in the bathroom was very loud, and the plumbing made strange noises in the night. 
	The walls were thin too. 
	Breakfast was okay, but there wasn’t much of it.`

	text: `I am interested in this job because I am currently looking for an opportunity to use the skills I learnt in my college. 
	I have recently completed a sixteen week part-time accounting course.  
	The course covered book-keeping, recording income and receipts and basic costing. 
	We used a wide range of computer packages, and I picked up the accounting skills easily. 
	I was able to work alone with very little extra help. 
	I passed the course with merit. 
	I believe my success was due to my thorough work, my numeracy skills and my attention to detail. 
	During the course, I had experience of working to deadlines and working under pressure.  
	Although this was sometimes stressful, I always completed my work on time.`

	text: `Unfortunately, the course did not include a work placement, so I have not practised my skills in a business setting, and I am now looking for an opportunity to do so.  
	I am particularly looking for a job in a small company such as yours, as I believe I will be able to interact with a wider range of people, and as a result, learn more skills.  
	I would like to progress within a company and gain more responsibilities over the years. 
	Although I do not have work experience in finance, I have experience in working in an office environment.
	Before starting the accounting course, I worked for six months in a recruitment office as a receptionist. 
	My duties involved meeting and greeting clients and visitors, taking phone calls, audio and copy typing and checking stock. 
	I also had to keep the petty cash and mail records.
	Through this work, I developed my verbal and written communication skills. 
	I had to speak confidently to strangers and deliver clear messages.  
	I enjoyed working in a team environment.  
	I believe the office appreciated my friendly manner and efficient work.`

	`Dearest creature in creation,
	Study English pronunciation.
	I will teach you in my verse
	Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse.
	I will keep you, Suzy, busy,
	Make your head with heat grow dizzy.
	Tear in eye, your dress will tear.
	So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.
	
	Just compare heart, beard, and heard,
	Dies and diet, lord and word,
	Sword and sward, retain and Britain.
	(Mind the latter, how it's written.)
	Now I surely will not plague you
	With such words as plaque and ague.
	But be careful how you speak:
	Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;
	Cloven, oven, how and low,
	Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.
	
	Hear me say, devoid of trickery,
	Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore,
	Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,
	Exiles, similes, and reviles;
	Scholar, vicar, and cigar,
	Solar, mica, war and far;
	One, anemone, Balmoral,
	Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;
	Gertrude, German, wind and mind,
	Scene, Melpomene, mankind.
	
	Billet does not rhyme with ballet,
	Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.
	Blood and flood are not like food,
	Nor is mould like should and would.
	Viscous, viscount, load and broad,
	Toward, to forward, to reward.
	And your pronunciation's OK
	When you correctly say croquet,
	Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,
	Friend and fiend, alive and live.
	
	Ivy, privy, famous; clamour
	And enamour rhyme with hammer.
	River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb,
	Doll and roll and some and home.
	Stranger does not rhyme with anger,
	Neither does devour with clangour.
	Souls but foul, haunt but aunt,
	Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant,
	Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger,
	And then singer, ginger, linger,
	Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge,
	Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.
	
	Query does not rhyme with very,
	Nor does fury sound like bury.
	Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth.
	Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath.
	Though the differences seem little,
	We say actual but victual.
	Refer does not rhyme with deafer.
	Foeffer does, and zephyr, heifer.
	Mint, pint, senate and sedate;
	Dull, bull, and George ate late.
	Scenic, Arabic, Pacific,
	Science, conscience, scientific.
	
	Liberty, library, heave and heaven,
	Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven.
	We say hallowed, but allowed,
	People, leopard, towed, but vowed.
	Mark the differences, moreover,
	Between mover, cover, clover;
	Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,
	Chalice, but police and lice;
	Camel, constable, unstable,
	Principle, disciple, label.
	
	Petal, panel, and canal,
	Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal.
	Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,
	Senator, spectator, mayor.
	Tour, but our and succour, four.
	Gas, alas, and Arkansas.
	Sea, idea, Korea, area,
	Psalm, Maria, but malaria.
	Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean.
	Doctrine, turpentine, marine.
	
	Compare alien with Italian,
	Dandelion and battalion.
	Sally with ally, yea, ye,
	Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.
	Say aver, but ever, fever,
	Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver.
	Heron, granary, canary.
	Crevice and device and aerie.
	
	Face, but preface, not efface.
	Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.
	Large, but target, gin, give, verging,
	Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.
	Ear, but earn and wear and tear
	Do not rhyme with here but ere.
	Seven is right, but so is even,
	Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,
	Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,
	Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.
	
	Pronunciation - think of Psyche!
	Is a paling stout and spikey?
	Won't it make you lose your wits,
	Writing groats and saying grits?
	It's a dark abyss or tunnel:
	Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale,
	Islington and Isle of Wight,
	Housewife, verdict and indict.
	
	Finally, which rhymes with enough -
	Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough?
	Hiccough has the sound of cup.
	My advice is to give up!`
