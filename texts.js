'The Little Prince':
`The first night, I sleep on the sand. 
I am a thousand miles from a land with people. 
I think that no people are around me. 
So I am shocked when somebody speaks to me in the morning. 
I hear these words: Please, draw me a sheep. 
What? Draw me a sheep! 
I jump up. I look around. And I see a little man. 
This is the picture of the little man.`,

'Hotel review #1':
`Six of us stayed here for the weekend. 
The first thing we noticed on entering our room was how small it was. 
Our rooms were clean, but the bed cover was stained.
The furniture was really outdated, especially the bathroom, which had an old pink suite and linoleum on the floor. 
The shower was a hose that you fit onto the taps.  
The sink was in the bedroom, right next to the television sockets which seems pretty unsafe to me. 
We had dinner there, and it was well-cooked, but we were still hungry afterwards because the servings were so tiny. 
The drinks prices were extortionate - five euro for a small glass of wine. 
My friend ordered a brandy and coke, but the waitress brought him whisky and coke. 
When we complained, she just walked off! Not impressed. 
I would like to say it was cheap and cheerful but at one hundred and twenty euro a night, it was neither - overpriced and depressing more like.`,

'Hotel review #2':
`Just returned from a three day break here, and thought that the Coach Hotel was very good value for money. 
I had requested a quiet room and this was noted at reception. 
I got a great room - large, comfortable and clean, with a seating area overlooking the racecourse. 
The only disappointing thing was that there were no tea or coffee facilities in the room - not even a kettle. 
The furniture and decor was not particularly up-to-date, but that’s what you would expect from an old hotel. 
There was a wide selection of well-cooked food on offer. 
At breakfast I had poached eggs, and they were done to perfection. 
In the evening, I had a delicious three-course meal, and I wasn’t kept waiting for ages between courses, which is definitely a plus when you’re dining alone. 
I found the staff friendly and always willing to help.`,

'Hotel review #3':
`The hotel’s is just two hundred metres walk away from the racecourse, so it’s really convenient. 
There’s plenty of space to park. 
The bed was comfortable with clean cotton sheets. 
Good power shower. 
I would agree with some of the less favourable reviews on the site too, though. 
The room definitely needed some attention – it smelt musty and the furniture was old, cheap and battered.  
The bin hadn't been emptied from previous guests, and there was other rubbish on the floor. 
The fan in the bathroom was very loud, and the plumbing made strange noises in the night. 
The walls were thin too. 
Breakfast was okay, but there wasn’t much of it.`,

'Job application #1':
`I am interested in this job because I am currently looking for an opportunity to use the skills I learnt in my college. 
I have recently completed a sixteen week part-time accounting course.  
The course covered book-keeping, recording income and receipts and basic costing. 
We used a wide range of computer packages, and I picked up the accounting skills easily. 
I was able to work alone with very little extra help. 
I passed the course with merit. 
I believe my success was due to my thorough work, my numeracy skills and my attention to detail. 
During the course, I had experience of working to deadlines and working under pressure.  
Although this was sometimes stressful, I always completed my work on time.`,

'Job application #2': 
`Unfortunately, the course did not include a work placement, so I have not practised my skills in a business setting, and I am now looking for an opportunity to do so.  
I am particularly looking for a job in a small company such as yours, as I believe I will be able to interact with a wider range of people, and as a result, learn more skills.  
I would like to progress within a company and gain more responsibilities over the years.`,

'Job application #3': 
`Although I do not have work experience in finance, I have experience in working in an office environment.
Before starting the accounting course, I worked for six months in a recruitment office as a receptionist. 
My duties involved meeting and greeting clients and visitors, taking phone calls, audio and copy typing and checking stock. 
I also had to keep the petty cash and mail records.
Through this work, I developed my verbal and written communication skills. 
I had to speak confidently to strangers and deliver clear messages.  
I enjoyed working in a team environment.  
I believe the office appreciated my friendly manner and efficient work.`,

'Free time #1':
`Studies say that people nowadays have more free time than ever before.
Then why doesn’t it feel that way?
These days, our free time is usually spent watching television, using computers or communicating on our phones. 
Images and information are constantly flashing into our brains, so it’s no wonder we don’t feel as if we have really switched off.  
To really wind down and help us regain our energy levels, it is important to use our free time wisely.`,

'Free time #2':
`Don’t let anything else encroach on your free time.
Ignore the washing up and the vacuuming.
Don’t check your inbox for messages and turn off your mobile phone.
Otherwise, the lines between free time and everyday live will begin to blur, and you won’t feel refreshed.`,

'Free time #3':
`In many free time activities, we take the role of consumer.  
When we watch TV, play video games or read, we are only passively involved.  
Take on the role of producer for a change.  
Build a model, write a blog or make an animation film.  
You will use a different part of your brains and will feel more energised as a result.`,
